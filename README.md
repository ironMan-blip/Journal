# Journal

This is a group project on Operating System for my university. It was created by

1. MD Mashrafi Mahmud Rafi 23201460 (me)
2. Tanvir Hasan Tutul 23201105

This project required us to add metadata journaling to a VSFS file system by writing a c program which logs the metadata changes first and then applies them to the program later, ensuring crash consistency. Both members wrote the program and contributed equally.
